# Placeholder Icons

This directory contains a collection of icons from the free [Android Action Bar Icon Pack][1] that can be used in place of the non-free icons used in the published version of this app. The icons are only intended to make it easy to build the app, not to be functional. To use them, copy the contents of this directory into the parent directory, merging the identically named `drawable` directories.
