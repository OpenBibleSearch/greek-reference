# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Greek Reference! Please take a moment to review the following guidelines to make sure your code can be integrated into the project as smoothly as possible.

## Process

1. Visit the [issue tracker][] and either create a new issue or comment on an existing issue that you'd like to work on. If you're thinking about working on a non-trivial change or addition, it would be a good idea to discuss it here first to make sure that it's a good fit for the project.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Base your changes on the `dev` branch.
4. Build and test the app with your new code. (I'd like to eventually add a test suite to the project, but for now, please manually ensure that your changes don't break anything.)
5. Submit a pull request targeted to the `dev` branch.

## Git Workflow

Greek Reference uses a simple workflow: All development is based on the `dev` branch, and the `master` branch represents the latest published release.
